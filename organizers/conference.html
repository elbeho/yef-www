<p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
As noted on the <a href="[% organizers_page %]">organizers' page</a>,
the YAPC::Europe conference is the single annual event where YEF is 
involved.  The <a href="[% venues_page %]">venue committee</a> is   
made up of both YEF board members and other previous YAPC::Europe
organizers.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="[% venues_page %]#schedule">annual schedule</a> gives
some indication of important dates related to the process.  The call
for proposals is published both in the YEF 
<a href="[% news_page %]">news section</a> as well as on a number
of Perl-related sites.  This announcement is authoritative concerning
the actual deadline for proposals. 
</p>

<p>
Some 
<a href="http://tpf.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/yapc/YAPC.pm">documentation 
for conference organizers</a> is available, but may not be completely
up-to-date.  We recommend that you 
<a href="[% root %]/yapc_proposals/index.html">review previous proposals</a>
to see what has been submitted in the past.  Submissions 
<strong>will be added to the website</strong>.  Please abide by the
following guidelines when crafting a proposal:
<ul>
<li>Write the proposal in plaintext or HTML.</li>
<li>Provide contact information, including phone numbers
    and email addresses, for all conference
    organizers.</li>
<li>Specify if there is any part of the proposal which you do not wish to
    be made public (contact information will be automatically withheld from
    publication).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Walking through an application</h2>
This section provides an example of how the application process proceeds.
Pisa's application for 2009 was selected as an example because the organizers
did not ask that any part of the document (other than personal contact
information) remain confidential.  Thus it is one of the most complete
proposals available.  
Pisa was also chosen because the group previously provided an account of the
<a href="[% workshop_stories_page %]">2008 Italian Perl Workshop</a>,
which provides the opportunity for experienced workshop organizers to see
the differences and similarities between YAPC::Europe and a workshop.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Statement of Intent</h3>
On April 13, 2009, the Pisa group sent an email to the venue committee
informing the committee that they would be submitting a proposal.
While this notification is not required, it allows the venue committee
to make personal enquires as the deadline nears if the proposal has not
yet been submitted.  On one occasion, the venue committee was able to
offer a short extension to a group which had previously expressed interest
(such an offer is only extended under rare circumstances).  The notification
also serves as a safeguard against the application not being delivered; if
the venue committee expects an application and does not receive it, the
committee will attempt to contact the group.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Application</h3>
On June 30, 2009, the Pisa group emailed their 
<a href="[% root %]/yapc_proposals/2010/Pisa.html">application 
to host YAPC::Europe 2010</a> to the venue committee.  The venue committee
responded with a confirmation.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Follow-up Questions</h3>
On July 6, 2009, the venue committee sent a 
<a href="[% root %]/yapc_proposals/2010/Pisa_questions.html">list of
questions</a> to the Pisa group.  These questions addressed parts of
the application which weren't understood, or issues which were not covered
by the application.  Some questions are always asked, while others might
be inspired by areas covered by the other proposals received.
One question which almost always comes up (although not included in 2009) is
the cost of beer!
</p>
<p>
On July 10, 2009, the Pisa group
<a href="[% root %]/yapc_proposals/2010/Pisa_answers.html">responded
with answers to the venue commitee's questions</a>.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Evaluation</h3>
The venue committee used the information provided by the candidate groups, as
well as information from other sources (such as personal knowledge of
the city/country, accounts of workshops held in the country, and general
sources of information) in order to evaluate the proposals.
Each committee member used her or his personal experience from having
organized a conference to weigh the importance of the different aspects
of the proposals.  The venue committee discussed the strengths and
weakness of the proposals before casting votes to select a venue.
The decision is always a complicated one, in part because the venue
committee must balance two different objectives when selecting a location.
One goal is to have a conference
which the attendees enjoy and which meets or exceeds the standards of
previous conferences.  YAPC::Europe is also intended to stimulate local
Perl organizations and to bring new people into the Perl community.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Notification</h3>
On July 20, 2009, the venue committee sent emails to all groups which
had submitted proposals informing them of the decision.  The YEF treasurer
contacted the winning group about the 
<a href="[% organizers_page%]#conferences">kickoff donation</a>.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Public Announcement</h3>
At <a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/">YAPC::Europe 2009 in Lisbon</a>, 
it was publically announced that Pisa would host YAPC::Europe 2010.
