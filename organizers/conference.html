<h2>Conferences</h2>
<a href="[% conferences_page %]">The YAPC::Europe conference</a>
is the one event where YEF (specifically
the Venue committee) has a hand in selecting the organizers and the
venue.  This is because only one event is held annually.  
</p>
Interested parties should look for the published
<a href="[% news_page %]">call for proposals</a>, which will contain
information about the proposal deadline.  It is typically announced
publicly on a number of Perl-related sites; the 
<a href="[% venue_page %]">venue committee's annual schedule</a>
gives an indication of important dates related to the process.
The <a href="http://tpf.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/yapc/YAPC.pm">YAPC
organizer's documentation</a> provides information useful to conference
organizers.  You may also wish to 
<a href="[% root %]/yapc_proposals/index.html">review some of the 
previous proposals</a> to see what the committee is looking for in a proposal.
</p>
<p>
The maximum <a href="[% donation_page %]">donation</a> for the 
YAPC::Europe conference 
is &euro; 1000.  Since 2009, the donation is automatically granted.
Once the organizers have been notified that their venue has been selected,
YEF's treasurer will send an email with information on arranging the 
transfer, which can generally be made in August.
