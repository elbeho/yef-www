<p>This page contains information for groups organizing Perl events.
</p>
<p>
YEF can assist event organizers in the following ways:
<ul>
<li><a href="[% payment_page %]">payment processing</li>
<li><a href="[% donation_page %]">donations</a></li>
<li><a href="[% act_page %]">conference registration</a> (with <a href="http://act.mongueurs.net/">Act</a>)</li>
</ul>
All assistance is subject to certain requirements and conditions; please
follow the aforementioned links for additional information.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Conferences</h2>
<a href="[% conferences_page %]">The YAPC::Europe conference</a>
is the one event where YEF (specifically
the Venue committee) has a hand in selecting the organizers and the
venue.  This is because only one event is held annually.  
</p>
<p>
Groups interested in hosting a YAPC::Europe can read more about the 
<a href="[% ye_org_page %]">selection process and schedule</a>.  The
information on this page assumes you have already been selected to host
a YAPC::Europe.
</p>
<p>
The maximum <a href="[% donation_page %]">donation</a> for the 
YAPC::Europe conference 
is &euro; 1000.  Since 2009, the donation is automatically granted.
Once the organizers have been notified that their venue has been selected,
YEF's treasurer will send an email with information on arranging the 
transfer, which can generally be made in August. 
</p>
<p>
As a conference organizer, you are invited to use the 
<a href="[% contact_page %]">general conferences mailing list</a> for
public discussions and announcements relating to the conference.
<p>
<h2>Workshops</h2>
<a href="[% workshops_page %]">Workshops</a>
are usually regional, with a region corresponding to a country
(such as Germany) or a small group of countries (the Nordic Perl Workshop,
for instance).  Any group can organize a workshop, but it's generally
best not to try to organize an event which would compete with an existing
workshop.  Consider speaking with previous organizers to get an idea of
what is involved in organizing a workshop.  You may also wish to
view <a href="[% workshop_stories_page %]">stories from previous workshop
organizers</a> about their experiences.
</p>
<p>
The maximum <a href="[% donation_page %]">donation</a>
for a workshop is &euro; 500.
The donation is never automatically granted;
it must be <a href="[% donation_page %]">specifically requested</a>.
</p>
<p>
As a workshop organizer, you are invited to
<a href="[% contact_page %]">send a mail to the workshop committee</a>
to be given access to the closed workshop organizer's mailing list where
you can discuss aspects of workshop organization with other organizers.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Hackathons</h2>
<a href="[% hackathons_page %]">Hackathons</a> 
can be organized by a smaller team because fewer participants are
involved.  As with workshops, there is no central authority, but people
who are considering hosting hackathons ought to discuss their plans on
the <a href="[% contact_page %]">conference organizer's mailing list</a>
to ensure that there won't be a conflicting event.  The Chicago hackathon
produced 
<a href="http://rakudo.org/hackathon-chicago/index.cgi?post_hackathon_recap">a
document about the lessons learnt</a> in the process of organizing a
hackathon. 
</p>
<p>
The maximum <a href="[% donation_page %]">donation</a>
for a hackathon is &euro; 500.
The donation is never automatically granted;
it must be <a href="[% donation_page %]">specifically requested</a>.
</p>
<p>
As a prospective hackathon organizer, you are invited to join the
<a href="http://mail.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/hackathons">hackathon 
mailing list</a> (not hosted by YEF) to discuss hackathon organization and
planning.
