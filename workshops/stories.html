<p>
Over the years, many workshops have been organized.  Workshops connect
with local Perl users and invite them to become members of the larger
Perl community.  
</p>
<p>
Most of the attempts to codify information have focused on the task of
organizing a <a href="[% conferences_page %]">YAPC::Europe conference</a>
Although much of this information is also of value to workshop organizers,
it is not all applicable.  We hope to collect the experiences of workshop
organizers for the benefit of future workshop organizers.  Some stories
are in narrative format, while others focus on figures.  If you have a
workshop story to share, please <a href="[% contact_page %]">contact the
web committee</a>.
</p>
For information about YEF's role in workshop organization or links to
YAPC::Europe documentation, please visit the

A list of upcoming and previous workshops can be found on the [% workshops %]

<h2>Italian Perl Workshop (2008)</h2>
</a>
by Enrico Sorcinelli<br />
<em>The IPW 2008 team consisted of Enrico Sorcinelli, Francesco Nidito, Gianni
Ceccarelli, Giuseppe D'Angelo, and Michele Beltrame.</em>
<em>A similar report was published on 
<a href="http://use.perl.org/~bepi/journal/37571">Use Perl</a>.</em><br />
<br />
The organization would like to thank you: without YEF (Act, on line
payments, etc.), the workshop would not have been so successful! :-)
</p>
<p>
On September 18 and 19, 2008,  the 
<a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/ipw2008/">Italian Perl 
Workshop 2008</a> took
place at the Computer Science Department of the University of Pisa.
</p><p>
It was a huge success; here are some numbers: 2 days of conference, 2
parallel tracks, more than 30 talks, 120 attendees,  20 sponsors, 3
patrons (Comune di Pisa, YAPC::Europe Foundation, Perl Foundation),
and many international guests, including: Tim Bunce, Rafa&euml;l
Garcia-Suarez, Marcus Ramberg and Matt S Trout.
</p>
<p>
It's been very satisfying for us to hear the positive feedback of
<a href="http://www.perl.it/blog/archives/000614.html">guests, speakers,
 participants</a> and of 
<a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/ipw2008/news/282">sponsors</a>.
</p>
<p>
More in depth: the IPW team worked very hard in order to make this the
best Italian workshop ever. In particular we took great care in public
relations with our sponsors.
</p>
<p>
