<h2><a name="comment"></a>A word from the treasurer</h2>
<p>
The first notable thing is that we end the year without any liability.
We started 2009 owing money to several conferences (one of them going back
as far as 2006). Nowadays, I'm following the online payments closely and
refunds are made on a monthly basis.
</p><p>
YEF made &euro;2500 of kickstart donations, which make 2009 our best year
yet (past kickstart donations amounted to &euro;1700 in 2007, and &euro;500
in 2008).
</p><p>
YEF received &euro;2637.50 in donations, which balances the kickstart
donations nicely. However, the online payment system in itself cost
&euro;600.91 this year.
</p><p>
Since I started as the main treasurer of YEF, I made sure most of the
money in our bank account was in the savings accounts, which provides
a small extra income. This year, it almost covers the monthly charge of
the bank account (&euro;91.40 vs. &euro;98.25).
</p><p>
Looking at all the numbers, I found out that the online payment system
is a significant part of the Foundation's expenses. Since the beginning,
YEF gave away &euro;4700 in kickstart donations, and spent &euro;2300.61
on the online payment system. In other words, almost one third of YEF's
sponsoring to the Perl community is spent on the online payment.
</p><p>
After looking back at 2009, we can now look forward to 2010:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Several conferences have already expressed interest in using YEF's online
payment system in 2010. So far, the Dutch Perl Workshop and YAPC Europe are
interested.
</li>
<li>Regarding conferences using the online payment system, I think we should
be more strict with past conferences, and ask for their pre- and post-
conference budgets, and put it on the website. This is the kind of
information new conference organizers will find useful.
</li>
<li>If YEF doesn't receive any donation in 2010, we can put a top limit
of &euro;3500 to the amount that can be spent on kickstart donations
(this leaves about &euro;800 for expenses, including the online payment).
</li>
