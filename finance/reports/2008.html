<p>
This year, some effort was spent on cleaning up the finances, and
processing all remaining refunds for the previous years online payment.
Apart from the refunds for the 2008 conferences, the following refunds
were processed:
<ul>
<li>Kickstart donation for Belgian Perl Workshop 2007 (voted in September 2007, processed in March 2008)</li>
<li>Last refund for YAPC Europe 2007 (processed in October 2008)</li>
<li>Full refund Twin City Perl Workshop 2008 (processed in January 2009)</li>
<li>Full refund for Italian Perl Worshop 2006 (processed in January 2009)</li>
<li>Full refund for French Perl Workshop 2007 (processed in February 2009)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Running the Foundation costs money: the
total of the bank fees for the year was of &euro;369.75.  The varying
part of this figure is the "online payment fees", which were low this
year (&euro;41.22) because there wasn't much money received through the
online payment. With YAPC Europe 2009, we can expect a lot more money
will be processed by YEF in 2009, and the online fees will be much higher.
</p></p>
I plan to enter the numbers for 2007 and the years before during 2009.
It will be interesting to see what are the yearly costs of running the
Foundation (basically, bank account + online payment charge +
online payment fees). My wet finger estimate is between &euro;500 and
&euro;750, depending on the amount of money going through the online
payment system.
