This directory contains some recently (probably not the latest revision)
compiled HTML files which were generated from the templates.

If you want to view these pages as if you were viewing the website,
simply make sure that the most recent 'stylesheet.css' (located in the
top-level checkout directory) is in the same directory as copies of
these files.  You might also want to copy the 'img/' directory and
its contents.

Note that you should not submit patches for any of these HTML files, as
these are not the original sources.


THIS DIRECTORY AND CONTENTS SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE BRANCH BEFORE
MERGING TO TRUNK!
