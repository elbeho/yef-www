<p>Founded in the Netherlands, as the 'YAPC::Europe Foundation' or 'YEF', the
current board also has members from England, Germany and France, plus
subcommittee members from other countries.</p>

<p>The YAPC::Europe Foundation is not a branch of 
<a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org">The Perl Foundation</a>, but
sometimes works in conjunction with TPF.  YEF focuses on a narrower range
of activities than TPF.</p>

<p>Our goal is to provide a focal point for Perl events in Europe.
To this end, we offer an on-line registration system, mailing lists,
advice, and may supply limited financial assistance.  We look forward
to being of service to like-minded Perl enthusiasts.</p>
