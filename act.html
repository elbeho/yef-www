<p>
<a href="http://act.mongueurs.net/">Act</a> is a conference management
toolkit originaly developed by the French Perl Mongers after the
YAPC::Europe 2003 conference.
</p>
<p>
The YAPC::Europe Foundation
<a href="[% payment_page %]">online payment system</a> can be connected
to a conference managed by Act.
Though it should be possible to install Act on any system, (the source
code is available), the YAPC::Europe online payment system is only
configured on the Act instance hosted by the French Perl Mongers. 
</p>
<p>
There are no dependencies here, it is possible to:
<ul>
<li>Host a YAPC::Europe, or workshop, using ACT.
<li>Host a YAPC::Europe, or workshop, using your own conferencing software.
<li>Use ACT for your own conference or workshop, unconnected with YEF in any way.
</ul>
</p>
If you do want your conference web site to be hosted on the official Act
platform, (and possibly use the YAPC::Europe online payment system),
you have to request the creation of a conference web site directly
to the Act team. The best way to do this is to subscribe to the
Act users mailing-list at
<a href="http://listes.mongueurs.net/mailman/listinfo/act"
