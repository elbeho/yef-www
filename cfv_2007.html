<h1>Call for Venue for YAPC::Europe::2007</h1>

<p>Although YAPC::Europe::2006 preparations are well underway in Birmingham, 
it is time for the YAPC::Europe Foundation to look for suitable sites for 
the 2007 conference. Any dedicated group interested in hosting 
YAPC::Europe::2007 should send a brief statement of intent to 
<A HREF="mailto:committee@yapceurope.org">committee@yapceurope.org</A>. This should be followed by a complete 
application. The deadline for applications is June 30, 2006. For more 
information about the requirements for hosting a conference, refer to the 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/YAPC/">YAPC::Venue</a>
module on CPAN, and look at the <a href="conferences.html">previous European conferences</a>
.</p>

<p>
You may also direct any questions to the 
aforementioned address. A decision on location will be announced at the 
end of the Birmingham conference.
