<p>
Because the YAPC::Europe Foundation does not have regular donors or a
large hoard of money, we make all donations available with the understanding
that if an event makes a profit they will consider making a return donation
to YEF so that we can continue to contribute toward future events.
</p>
<p>
You can request a donation by <a href="[% contact_page %]">mailing YEF</a>.
This letter should include a rough estimate of projected expenses as
well as a request for a specific amount.  The default maximum donations
are listed below by event type.  If the donation is granted, we require
identification and bank information; you can ensure that there is a minimal
delay by having this information ready.  The board should respond within
two weeks.  If the proposal is accepted, you will be given a contract
which describes the donation 
(an <a href="[% root %]/example_contracts/donation.pdf">example contract</a>
is available for review).  Once the contract is received by the
board chairperson, the money will be transferred.
</p>
<p>
In considering a donation, the board looks at the amount of money it has
available and the viability of the event.  Specifically, we want to make
sure that the event isn't competing with similar events (by being at the
same time or in the same region as a well-established event), and that
the budget is realistic.
