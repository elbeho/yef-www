<p>
We do not currently have an automated system which can accept 
donations to YEF.  If you would like to make a donation to YEF,
please send a letter to the <a href="[% contact_page %]">general address</a>
telling us how much you would like to donate.  
</p>
<p>
Our treasurer will
respond with information on how to make a transfer to our account.
Please use 'DONATION' as the first word of the description.
</p>
<p>
Once the donation is made, our chair will send you a letter thanking
you for the donation.  This letter can be used to prove to tax authorities
that you have made a donation.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for considering a donation to YEF.
