The YAPC::Europe Venue Committee is here to discuss the city/country to host
the next YAPC::Europe from the available proposals.  Members are all, previous
or current, conference organisers, so there is a great deal of relevant
experience on the committee.  Other tasks include advising the YEF board on
kickstart sponsorship, and liasing with the chosen venue during the planning
phase.  YAPC::Europe::2007 will be held in 
<a href="http://vienna.yapceurope.org/ye2007/">Vienna, Austria</a>.  
Initial proposals are welcomed for the following year at any time, and an
official <b>YEF - Call for Venue - 2008</b> will be posted at the appropriate
time.
