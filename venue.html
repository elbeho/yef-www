<h2>YAPC::Europe Venue Committee Page</h2><br />

The YAPC::Europe Venue Committee is here to discuss the city/country to host
the next YAPC::Europe from the available proposals.  Members are all, previous
or current, conference organisers, so there is a great deal of relevant
experience on the committee.  Other tasks include advising the YEF board on
kickstart sponsorship, and liasing with the chosen venue during the planning
phase.  YAPC::Europe::2007 will be held in Vienna, Austria.  Initial proposals
are welcomed for the following year (2008) at any time, and an official 
<b>YEF - Call for Venue - 2008</b> 
will be posted at the appropriate time.
