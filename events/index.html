<p>
The primary goal of YEF is to promote Perl events in Europe.  Events
can range from [% conferences %] to [% workshops %] to [% hackathons %].
We do not directly organize the events, but instead provide assistance
to local teams of [% organizers %].  
<!--
People who are interested in organizing an event are advised to look
at our information on the subject, located in the foundation section.

<h2>Conferences</h2>
The <a href="[% conferences_page %]">YAPC</a>, 
or 'Yet Another Perl Conference', is an annual event.  Each
year a different host city is selected.  
<a href="[% conferences_page %]">Conferences</a>
are pan-European, with English being the primary language of the event.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Workshops</h2>
<a href="[% workshops_page %]">Workshops</a> 
are typically smaller than conferences, and aim to attract
a local audience.  Consequently, talks are frequently given in the
regional language(s), or a mix of the local language(s) and English.
</p>
<p>
Regions usually correspond with a country or a small group of countries
and there is typically at most one workshop per region annually.  This
means that there are several workshops across Europe each year.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Hackathons</h2>
<a href="[% hackathons_page %]">Hackathons</a>
are intense events where people with a common interest in a
project or projects meet together to work on that project in particular.
Instead of having formal talks, participants work together. 
</p>
<p>
Hackathons can have a large geographic scope, and there may be several of
them annually.

possible on all Perl conferences that happened over the years.
