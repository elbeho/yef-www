<h1>Perl Hackathons</h1>
Hackathons are events where people with a common interest in a project
or projects gather to work on the code or documentation relating to that
project.  They are not only for experts; curious people can also attend.
Unlike <a href="workshops.html">workshops</a> or 
<a href="conferences.html">conferences</a>, the goal of a hackathon is
to produce actual code and allow participants to learn more about the
specific project(s).

There have been no European hackathons to date.
