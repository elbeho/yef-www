<p>
Hackathons are events where people with a common interest in a project
or projects gather to work on the code or documentation relating to that
project.  They are not only for experts; curious people can also attend.
Unlike [% workshops %] or [% conferences %], the goal of a hackathon is
to produce actual code and allow participants to learn more about the
specific project(s).
