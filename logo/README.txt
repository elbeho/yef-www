The YAPC Europe Foundation logo
-------------------------------

The current logo is inspired by the European flag:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_flag

The proportions are: 1x1.5 for the flag, 1/3 for the circle radius, 1/18 
for the stars radius.

Starting from the SVG file linked on the Wikipedia file, the twelve stars
have simply been replaced by twelve Perl onions in Philippe_Bruhat_1.svg.
