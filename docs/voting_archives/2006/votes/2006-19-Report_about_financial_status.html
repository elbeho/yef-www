<h1>PROPOSAL TEXT</h1>

<p>The board needs to be informed regularly of the financial status          
of the foundation.  Therefore a spreadsheet (or other database                  
format) has to be made with all financial transactions made by the              
foundation (not including all separate ACT transmissions on behalf of           
the YAPC and workshop events).</p>
<p>In the Birmingham minutes an extensive list of information is mentioned
that needs to be included.  This spreadsheet must be made and supplied
to the board members once every quarter.  At least once a year these
finances need to be discussed by the officials (normally, this means
that only the big and/or unusual money transfers will be discussed, and
"discussed" normally means "additional info by the treasurer on top
of the 1 or 2 line description").</p>
<p>Until now, this has not be done, so a date has to be set on which we
have to do this. Therefore we will request the treasurer to make such
a spreadsheet and prepare the finance discussion. It should be done in
two steps. Preparation of a short list within 4 weeks and of the extended
list within 10 weeks.</p>
<p>The short list should contain for each transaction:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="item_date__________________________________________________________________________item___name_of_recipient_sender______________________________________________________item___Gross_amount__________________________________________________________________item___One_or_two_word_classification__examples__Office_Supply__Bank_Costs___________back"></a><b>date                                                                        
=item * name of recipient/sender                                                    
=item * Gross amount                                                                
=item * One or two word classification (examples: Office Supply; Bank Costs...)
