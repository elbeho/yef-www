<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>This procedure describes the roles of the different members of the
YAPC Europe Foundation, as well as the procedure to include new members.</p>
<h1>MEMBER ROLES</h1>

<h2>Official members</h2>
<p>According to the legal status of the Foundation, the "board members" are
those who are registered at the "chamber of commerce" in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>To avoid confusion, they are called "official members" (or "officials"
for short) within the Foundation.</p>
<p>The officials are liable for the foundation in the legal sense.
They are registered and their duties are stated in the "statutes of
the foundation".</p>
<p>To add or to change "officials" the Foundation has to apply at the
"chamber of commerce" again.</p>
<p>The powers of the official are described in the statutes and derive
from the fact that they are legaly responsible of the actions of the
Foundation.</p>
<p>The powers of the officials are described below.</p>
<h2>Co-opted members</h2>
<p>All other members are "co-opted members" or "officers" ("coops" for short).</p>
<p>The coops are designated by the officials.</p>
<h1>THE FOUNDATION INSTANCES</h1>

<h2>The officials</h2>
<p>The officials can:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="item_a__Appoint_a_new_board_member__or_dismiss_a_board_member"></a><b>a. Appoint a new board member, or dismiss a board member</b>
</li>
<li><a name="item_b__Dissolve_the_foundation"></a><b>b. Dissolve the foundation</b>
</li>
<li><a name="item_c__Appoint_or_dismiss_a_coop"></a><b>c. Appoint or dismiss a coop</b>
</li>
<li><a name="item_d__Decide_on_expenses"></a><b>d. Decide on expenses</b>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The board</h2>
<p>The board consist of the officials plus the coops.</p>
<p>The officials have decided that the board can decide on all issues,
except the 4 mentioned above. The board therefore decides for instance
on issues like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="item_a__Install_a_committee__dissolve_a_committee_"></a><b>a. Install a committee, dissolve a committee.</b>
</li>
<li><a name="item_b__Appoint_or_dismiss_committee_members_"></a><b>b. Appoint or dismiss committee members.</b>
</li>
<li><a name="item_c__Vote_on_proposals_made_by_committees_"></a><b>c. Vote on proposals made by committees.</b>
</li>
<li><a name="item_d__Ask_a_committee_to_investigate_an_issue_and_make_a_proposal_"></a><b>d. Ask a committee to investigate an issue and make a proposal.</b>
</li>
<li><a name="item_e__Set_a_deadline_for_any_discussion_to_be_held_by_the_board_or_by_a_committee_"></a><b>e. Set a deadline for any discussion to be held by the board or by a committee.</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When the board has to decide on any issue, the board can set a
deadline for their members to reach a decision.  Until that deadline,
board members can discuss all aspects of the issue, put forward their
objections, investigate alternatives, prices, pro's, con's,
etc. When the deadline is reached, all board members vote. The
whole board will accept the outcome of the vote.</p>
<h2>Commitees</h2>
<p>Committees are created by the board, which also selects their members.</p>
<p>Committees don't vote on membership of committee members or
proposals.  They discuss an issue, write a proposal which includes
the choices which they discussed, the alternatives, pro's and con's,
any money involved, deadlines, etc, and of course the decision that
they think the board has to make.  A committee can propose to appoint
a new committee member.  The committee proposes and explains why the
proposal is as it is, the board decides (rubberstamps).</p>
<p>Of course, most of the time the board has seen at least parts of the
discussion of the committee. Often, one or more of the board members
will be committee members too. Therefore, it will be a seldom
occasion that that the board will vote against a committee
proposal.</p>
<p>Committees don't need to have a board member as committee member.</p>
<p>The current list of committees is:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="item_YAPC_committee"></a><b>YAPC committee</b>
<p>This committee is responsible for writing the call for venue for the
next YAPC Europe conference, set a deadline for proposals, receive them,
discuss and compare them.</p>
<p>The committee then makes an argumented proposal to the board, which accepts
or refuses the proposal.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Workshop_committee"></a><b>Workshop committee</b>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Public_Relations_committee"></a><b>Public Relations committee</b>
<p>This committee can only have board members.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Web_site_committee"></a><b>Web site committee</b>
<p>The web site committee is in charge of keeping the YEF web site up to date.</p>
<p>This committee can only have board members.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>NEW COMMITTEE MEMBERS</h1>

<p>The board will ask selected organizers of previous (and current)
YAPC::Europe conferences if they are interested to become a member of
the YAPC Venue Committee.</p>
<p>The same for selected organizers of previous Perl Workshops, for the
Workshop Committee.</p>
