<h1>PREREQUISITES</h1>

<p>This procedure starts after the organisers are ready to organise their
conference, have decided to use the Act conference management system,
and have contacted the people responsible for Act.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://act.mongueurs.net/">http://act.mongueurs.net/</a> for details.
[FIXME - this site should explicitely list some contact information
for setting up an Act web site.]</p>
<h1>DETAILED SCHEDULE</h1>

<h2>Contact YEF</h2>
<p>If the conference organisers want to use the YEF online payment system,
they should contact YEF to sign a contract.</p>
<p>A template of the contract is available on YEF's website at the
following address: <i>FIXME</i>.</p>
<h2>Fill-in and sign the contract with YEF</h2>
<p>The organisers send the required information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>name of the Conference</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>name of the Organiser</p>
<p>If the organiser is a non-profit organisation, this means the name,
address, date of creation of the organisation (as many information
as possible.)</p>
<p>If the organiser is an individual, his means their name, address
and telephone number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>responsible person</p>
<p>If the organiser is a non-profit organisation, this means the name,
address and telephone number of the chairperson.</p>
<p>If the organiser is an individual, this means the same as above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bank account information</p>
<p>This is bank account to which the money received through the online payment
system will be sent. The information needed is the bank name, address
and IBAN (International Bank Account Number) for the bank account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>scans of a valid identification paper for all persons involved.</p>
<p>Identification paper means identity card, passport, etc.
This enables YEF to claim that it really knows who the organisers are.
A 300dpi scan is sufficient.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This information is used to produce a PDF file of a contract
of which print two copies shoudl printed, signed and send to YEF
by the organisers.</p>
<p>YEF will send back one copy signed by its Chairperson.</p>
<h2>Setup the online payment system in the Act configuration</h2>
<p>The YEF online payment system in Act will be enabled only once
the contract is signed and approved by YEF. This is done by
the Act administrators (they are not necessary members of YEF).</p>
<h2>Organise the conference and receive payments</h2>
<p>During this pre-conference time, payments are received on the
online payment system.</p>
<p>During this period of time, YEF's treasurer sends the money on
a regular basis. The periodicity and mean of payment (cheque,
transfer, etc) is to be discussed between the treasurer
and the organisers on a per-conference basis.</p>
<p>YEF treasurer will never sens more than what the attendees have paid
(that is to say: YEF does not give "advance money"). The treasurer will
also send a short summary to the board each time he sends money to
conference organisers.</p>
<p>95% of the payment will be paid before the conference.
The remaining 5% (in case of fraudulent payments not yet detected by
the bank) will be paid at most 4 months after the end of the conference.</p>
<h2>Close the online payment system</h2>
<p>The online payment system will be closed on the day after the end of
the conference.</p>
<h2>YEF publishes the payment information</h2>
<p>As stated in the contract:</p>
<pre>    The Foundation treasurer will publish a detailled account of the money
    received, paid and transfered for the Conference. A printed copy
    signed by the Foundation's Treasurer will be send to the Organiser
    no further than *two months* after the end of the Conference.</pre>

<p>YEF will also publish a yearly status on its profits and expenses,
particularly how much the foundation received from the online payment
system, how much it paid in fees, and how much money was send, for each
conference that used the online payment system. This should be a 3 line
summary for each conference.</p>
