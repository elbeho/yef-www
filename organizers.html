<h2>Overview</h2>
YEF can assist event organizers by offering payment processing and
conference registration.  Donations are also available.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Payment processing</h3>

<p>
<h3>Donation</h3>
Because the YAPC::Europe Foundation does not have regular donors or a
large hoard of money, we make all donations available with the understanding
that if an event makes a profit they will consider making a return donation
to YEF so that we can continue to contribute toward future events.
</p>
<p>
You can request a donation by <a href="[% contact_page %]">mailing YEF</a>.
This letter should include a rough estimate of projected expenses as
well as a request for a specific amount.  The default maximum donations
are listed below by event type.  If the donation is granted, we require
identification and bank information; you can ensure that there is a minimal
delay by having this information ready.  The board should respond within
two weeks.  If the proposal is accepted, you will be given a contract
which describes the donation 
(an <a href="[% root %]/example_contracts/donation.pdf">example contract</a>
is available for review).  Once the contract is received by the
board chairperson, the money will be transferred.
</p>
<p>
In considering a donation, the board looks at the amount of money it has
available and the viability of the event.  Specifically, we want to make
sure that the event isn't competing with similar events (by being at the
same time or in the same region as a well-established event), and that
the budget is realistic.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Conferences</h2>
<a href="[% conferences_page %]">The YAPC::Europe conference</a>
is the one event where YEF (specifically
the Venue committee) has a hand in selecting the organizers and the
venue.  This is because only one event is held annually.  
</p>
Interested parties should look for the published
<a href="[% news_page %]">call for proposals</a>, which will contain
information about the proposal deadline.  It is typically announced
publicly on a number of Perl-related sites in March. The
<a href="http://tpf.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/yapc/YAPC.pm">YAPC
organizer's documentation</a> provides information useful to conference
organizers.  You may also wish to review some of the previous proposals 
to see what the committee is looking for in a proposal:
<ul>
<li><a href="[% root %]/yapc_proposals/2007/vienna.html">Vienna</a> (selected for YAPC::Europe 2007)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The maximum donation for a conference is &euro; 1000.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Workshops</h2>
<a href="[% workshops_page %]">Workshops</a>
are usually regional, with a region corresponding to a country
(such as Germany) or a small group of countries (the Nordic Perl Workshop,
for instance).  Any group can organize a workshop, but it's generally
best not to try to organize an event which would compete with an existing
workshop.  Consider speaking with previous organizers to get an idea of
what is involved in organizing a workshop.
</p>
<p>
The maximum donation for a workshop is &euro; 500.
</p>

<p>
<h2>Hackathons</h2>
<a href="[% hackathons_page %]">Hackathons</a> 
can be organized by a smaller team because fewer participants are
involved.  As with workshops, there is no central authority, but people
who are considering hosting hackathons ought to discuss their plans on
the <a href="[% contact_page %]">conference organizer's mailing list</a>
to ensure that there won't be a conflicting event.  The Chicago hackathon
produced 
<a href="http://rakudo.org/hackathon-chicago/index.cgi?post_hackathon_recap">a
document about the lessons learnt</a> in the process of organizing a
hackathon. 
</p>
<p>
The maximum donation for a hackathon is &euro; 500.
