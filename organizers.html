<p>
The primary ways in which we can assist conference organizers are:
(complimentary) payment processing, advice, and donations.
</p>

<p>
<h2>Conferences</h2>
YAPC conferences are designated by the Venue committee.  Potential
organizers should submit a proposal as described in the published
<a href="[% news_page %]">call for proposals</a>, which is typically
released in the late winter or early spring.  
To make certain that you address the requirements and concerns of the
committee, you are advised to review previous proposals:
<ul>
<li><a href="[% root %]/yapc_proposals/2007/vienna.html">Vienna</a> (Y::E 2007)</li>
</ul>
</p>

Conference organizers are welcome to use the French Perl Monger's Act
system in conjunction with YEF's backend.  This system provides registration
and also payment processing.
