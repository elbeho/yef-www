YEF can assist event organizers by offering:
<ul>
<li><a href="[% act_page %]">payment processing and
conference registration</a> and </li>
<li> <a href="[% donation_page %]">donations</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<h2>Conferences</h2>
<a href="[% conferences_page %]">The YAPC::Europe conference</a>
is the one event where YEF (specifically
the Venue committee) has a hand in selecting the organizers and the
venue.  This is because only one event is held annually.  
</p>
Interested parties should look for the published
<a href="[% news_page %]">call for proposals</a>, which will contain
information about the proposal deadline.  It is typically announced
publicly on a number of Perl-related sites in March. The
<a href="http://tpf.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/yapc/YAPC.pm">YAPC
organizer's documentation</a> provides information useful to conference
organizers.  You may also wish to review some of the previous proposals 
to see what the committee is looking for in a proposal:
<ul>
<li><a href="[% root %]/yapc_proposals/2007/vienna.html">Vienna</a> (selected for YAPC::Europe 2007)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The maximum <a href="[% donation_page %]">donation</a> for a 
conference is &euro; 1000.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Workshops</h2>
<a href="[% workshops_page %]">Workshops</a>
are usually regional, with a region corresponding to a country
(such as Germany) or a small group of countries (the Nordic Perl Workshop,
for instance).  Any group can organize a workshop, but it's generally
best not to try to organize an event which would compete with an existing
workshop.  Consider speaking with previous organizers to get an idea of
what is involved in organizing a workshop.
</p>
<p>
The maximum <a href="[% donation_page %]">donation</a>
for a workshop is &euro; 500.
</p>

<p>
<h2>Hackathons</h2>
<a href="[% hackathons_page %]">Hackathons</a> 
can be organized by a smaller team because fewer participants are
involved.  As with workshops, there is no central authority, but people
who are considering hosting hackathons ought to discuss their plans on
the <a href="[% contact_page %]">conference organizer's mailing list</a>
to ensure that there won't be a conflicting event.  The Chicago hackathon
produced 
<a href="http://rakudo.org/hackathon-chicago/index.cgi?post_hackathon_recap">a
document about the lessons learnt</a> in the process of organizing a
hackathon. 
</p>
<p>
The maximum <a href="[% donation_page %]">donation</a>
for a hackathon is &euro; 500.
