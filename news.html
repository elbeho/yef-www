<h2>Vienna selected for YAPC::Europe 2007</h2><br />

YAPC::Europe Foundation is pleased to announce
that Vienna, Austria has been chosen as the site for the 
<a href="http://vienna.yapceurope.org/">YAPC::Europe 2007</a>,
the eigth European YAPC.
</p>
<p>

Vienna faced tough competition from Lyon, France and Pisa, Italy, and
we hope that these groups will give us the opportunity to consider their
proposals again in the future.
</p>
<p>

We are confident that Vienna.pm's experienced team--which was responsible
for several Austrian Perl Workshops--will put together a wonderful conference.
The theme for the next YAPC::Europe will be 'Social Perl'.
</p>
<p>
We hope to see you in Vienna next summer!
