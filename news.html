<h2>Announcement: YAPC Venue Committee</h2></a>
The YEF board are pleased to announce the creation of the YAPC (Yet Another
Perl Conference) Venue Committee.  This committee is responsible for selecting
the city/country to host the next YAPC::Europe from the available proposals.
Members are all, previous or current, conference organisers, so there is a
great deal of relevant experience on the committee.  Other tasks include
advising the YEF board on kickstart sponsorship, and liasing with the chosen
venue during the planning phase.
</p><p>
The current members of the YAPC Venue Committee are:
<ul>
<li>       Ann Barcomb (2001 Amsterdam)</li>
<li>       Barbie (2006 Birmingham)</li>
<li>       Jos&eacute; Alves de Castro (2005 Braga)</li>
<li>       Philippe (Book) Bruhat (2003 Paris)</li>
<li>       Richard Foley (2002 Munich)</li>
<li>       Thomas Klausner (2007 Vienna)</li>
<li>       Karen Pauley (2004 Belfast)</li>
<li>       Alberto Sim&otilde;es (2005 Braga)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Vienna selected for YAPC::Europe 2007</h2></a>

YAPC::Europe Foundation is pleased to announce
that Vienna, Austria has been chosen as the site for the 
<a href="http://vienna.yapceurope.org/">YAPC::Europe 2007</a>,
the eigth European YAPC.
</p>
<p>

Vienna faced tough competition from Lyon, France and Pisa, Italy, and
we hope that these groups will give us the opportunity to consider their
proposals again in the future.
</p>
<p>

We are confident that Vienna.pm's experienced team--which was responsible
for several Austrian Perl Workshops--will put together a wonderful conference.
The theme for the next YAPC::Europe will be 'Social Perl'.
</p>
<p>
We hope to see you in Vienna next summer!
