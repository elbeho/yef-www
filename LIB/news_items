<p>The <a href="venue_committee.html">YEF Venue Committee</a> would like to announce that we have received two
very interesting bids, from two great cities, to host YAPC::Europe 2009!
The two capitals, <strong>Moscow</strong> and <strong>Lisbon</strong>, have submitted very strong
proposals and the YEF Venue Commitee have a very hard task ahead of them
in deciding who will have the honour of hosting the next YAPC::Europe.
Over the next few weeks the committee will take a very close look at the
proposals, clarifying any issue we raise with the prospective
organisers, before we make a final decision for the host of YAPC::Europe
2009.</p>

<p>The public announcement for the location of YAPC::Europe 2009 will be
given during <a
href="http://yapceurope2008.org">YAPC::Europe 2008 in Copenhagen</a>. So if you want to be among
the first to know where to go in 2009, come to Copenhagen this summer!</p>

<p>
While we are all looking forward to <a
href="http://www.yapceurope2008.org/ye2008/">YAPC::Europe 2008 in
Copenhagen</a>,
it's time for the YAPC::Europe Venue Committee to consider suitable
hosts for the 2009 conference. Any dedicated group interested in hosting
YAPC::Europe::2009 should send a brief statement of intent to
venue@yapceurope.org as soon as possible. For this first statement of
intent a few lines like "City.pm is interested in hosting YAPC::Europe
2009" will be enough.
</p>

<p>
A full and complete application should then be sent to the same address
prior to the deadline for applications, which is June 30, 2008. The
YAPC::Europe Venue Committee will inform applicants by July 31, 2008
if their proposal was chosen. The public announcement of the location
for the 2009 conference will be announced during the 2008 conference in
Copenhagen.

you may want to refer to the <a href="http://tpf.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/yapc/YAPC.pm">YAPC organiser's
documentation</a> (administered by TPF) on Google code, or look at the <a href="http://www.yapceurope.org/yapc_proposals/index.html">examples of previous European conferences</a>.

Please direct any questions to venue@yapceurope.org, and a member of the

YAPC::Europe Foundation is pleased to announce that Copenhagen, Denmark
has been chosen as the site for YAPC::Europe 2008, the ninth European
YAPC. 
</p>
<p>
Copenhagen faced stiff competition from Braga, Portugal, which hosted
a memorable YAPC::Europe in 2005.  This year also marked the first
submission from a group unaffiliated with Perlmongers: the
Informatics department of Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in
Cambridge, United Kingdom.  We hope that both these groups will
give us the opportunity to consider their proposals again in the
future.
</p>
<p>
We are confident that Copenhagen.pm's experienced team--which was
responsible for several Nordic Perl Workshops--will put together a
wonderful conference.

We hope to see you in Copenhagen next summer!
