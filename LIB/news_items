<p>
<a href="http://yapceurope.org/2009">YAPC::EU::2009</a>, 
the 10th edition of the largest European Perl conference,
will be held in Lisbon, Portugal, from the 3rd to the 5th of August, 2009.
</p><p>
This is the official Call for Presentations and here are the important
deadlines:
<ul>
 <li> Deadline for talk proposals: April 30th 2009</li>
 <li> Speaker notification: May 7th 2009</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
This year's theme for the conference is Corporate Perl.
</p><p>
Here's what we're looking for:
<ul>
 <li> We're looking for talks on how corporate companies use Perl and why;</li>

 <li> We're looking for talks to fit our beginner's track (if you want to
submit one and don't know what about, reach us at
organizers@yapceurope2009.org and we'll share with you our preliminary draft
of an expected beginner's track);</li>

 <li>And, as usual, there is also enough room for talks that don't fit any of
those groups, so we'll be looking for and expecting dozens of proposal on
everything that is Perl related.</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
We'll be offering two kinds of time-slots for talks:
<ul>
 <li> 20 minutes</li>

 <li> 40 minutes</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
If you really need a different time-slot, get in touch with us and we'll see
what we can do.

</p><p>
Speakers may submit multiple talks. All speakers will have their
registration fee waived.
<ul>
 <li> To submit a talk, go to 
<a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/newtalk">http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/newtalk</a></li>

 <li> If you don't have a user yet, please register at
<a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/register">http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/register</a></li>
</ul>
</p><p>
For any inquiry, contact us at organizers@yapceurope2009.org, and don't
forget to submit your proposals no later than midnight GMT on April 30th,
2009.

<p>The <a href="venue_committee.html">YEF Venue Committee</a> would like to announce that we have received two
very interesting bids, from two great cities, to host YAPC::Europe 2009!
The two capitals, <strong>Moscow</strong> and <strong>Lisbon</strong>, have submitted very strong
proposals and the YEF Venue Commitee have a very hard task ahead of them
in deciding who will have the honour of hosting the next YAPC::Europe.
Over the next few weeks the committee will take a very close look at the
proposals, clarifying any issue we raise with the prospective
organisers, before we make a final decision for the host of YAPC::Europe
2009.</p>

<p>The public announcement for the location of YAPC::Europe 2009 will be
given during <a
href="http://yapceurope2008.org">YAPC::Europe 2008 in Copenhagen</a>. So if you want to be among
the first to know where to go in 2009, come to Copenhagen this summer!</p>

YAPC::Europe Foundation is pleased to announce that Copenhagen, Denmark
has been chosen as the site for YAPC::Europe 2008, the ninth European
YAPC.

<p>
Copenhagen faced stiff competition from Braga, Portugal, which hosted

submission from a group unaffiliated with Perlmongers: the
Informatics department of Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in
Cambridge, United Kingdom.  We hope that both these groups will
give us the opportunity to consider their proposals again in the
future.

We are confident that Copenhagen.pm's experienced team--which was

wonderful conference.
