<p>The YAPC::Europe Foundation is here to provide support for Perl conferences in Europe. We're not an offshoot of <a href="http://www.yetanother.org">YAS</a>,
our purpose is more focused on conference related business. Of course, though, we work hand in hand for the benefit of all.</p>
<p>The aim is to provide a focal point, organise on-line registration, mailing
lists, technical and conference advice and to generally support activities,
encouraging Perl Conferences and Workshops in Europe and environs.</p>

<p>Founded in the Netherlands, as the ``YAPC::Europe Foundation'' or 'YEF', the
current board also has members from England, Germany and France.  Adhoc
committee members will be co-opted from relevant countries based on experience.</p>
<p>We look forward to helping, guiding and just plain 'being there' for groups of
like-minded Perl enthusiasts in and around Europe.</p>
