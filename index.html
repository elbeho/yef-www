<p>The YAPC::Europe Foundation is here to provide support for Perl conferences in
Europe.  The YAPC::Europe website (here :) is (still under construction...):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.yapceurope.org">http://www.yapceurope.org</a></p>
<p>We're not an offshoot of <a href="http://www.yetanother.org">YAS</a>&nbsp;:<br>
our purpose is more focused on conference related business.</p>
<p>Of course, though, we work hand in hand for the benefit of all.<br></p>
<p>The aim is to provide a focal point, organise on-line registration, mailing
lists, technical and conference advice and to generally support activities,
encouraging Perl Conferences and Workshops in Europe and environs:</p>

<p>Founded in the Netherlands, as the ``YAPC::Europe Foundation'' or 'YEF', the
current board also has members from England, Germany and France.  Adhoc
committee members will be co-opted from relevant countries based on experience.</p>
<p>We look forward to helping, guiding and just plain 'being there' for groups of
like-minded Perl enthusiasts in and around Europe.</p>
